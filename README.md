# Air pollution and road transport in Europe
 Project univeristy: analyzing the pollution levels in different (European)  countries and the impact of policies adopted for reducing pollution.

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the levels of air pollution in various European countries and understand the impact of different policies implemented to reduce pollution. In addition, this project focuses also on analyzing the relationship between transportation habits and air pollution in Europe over the last 30 years. It investigates how changes in vehicle types and the adoption of public transport have impacted the emission of pollutants. In this work, it tracks emissions from 1990 to 2021, highlighting trends in CO2 emissions across Europe, particularly noting decreases during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last part, it examines policies, including emission standards, promotion of electric vehicles, and public transportation usage, to determine their effect on reducing pollution and achieving EU climate goals.
